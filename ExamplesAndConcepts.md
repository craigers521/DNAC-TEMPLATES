# Practical Template Examples [![published](https://static.production.devnetcloud.com/codeexchange/assets/images/devnet-published.svg)](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/repo/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES)
When working with many customers over the past 6 years with automation, I have seen the same questions asked in workshop after workshop. Are there practical examples of templates that we can use as a starting point to begin deploying with automation.

After working with well over 30 customers, I have come up with templates which fit for the majority of typical access switch situations. 

Within this section we will only deal with the non Fabric environment and deployment.

## Plug and Play (PnP) Template
### Why
To help get started with and better understand the PnP process we have provided this material. It is designed to help you understand the Plug and Play process, templates and deployment of these within a lab setting. Once you are comfortable with the concepts you can work on a deployment and implementation plan for your network.

### What
To help get started with the PnP process and to better understand the process, please review the following information:

1. [PnP Workflow](./PnP-Workflow.md)
2. [Onboarding](./Onboarding.md)
3. [Templates](./Templates.md)

### How
To let you practice and get experience with the PnP process to better understand it, please review the following information:

1. [PnP Preparation](./LABS/LAB1-PNP-PREP/README.md)
2. [Onboarding Templates](./LABS/LAB2-Onboarding-Template/README.md)

This material is designed to help you understand the Plug and Play process, templates and deployment of these within a lab setting.

### Where 
Within the following location is an example template in JSON format which can be imported into the **Onboarding Configuration** section in the Template Editor/Hub:

## Summary
These examples are ready for testing in your lab. These are aides to help you get up to speed with what is possible when automating with DNA Center. The intent of this part of the repository is to aide in learning and not provide production ready templates. All templates here are for **LAB Purposes ONLY** and by downloading any content you acknowledge that this is not production ready code.
