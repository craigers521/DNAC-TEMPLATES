# Practical Template Examples [![published](https://static.production.devnetcloud.com/codeexchange/assets/images/devnet-published.svg)](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/repo/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES)
When working with many customers over the past 6 years with automation, I have seen the same questions asked in workshop after workshop. Are there practical examples of templates that we can use as a starting point to begin deploying with automation.

After working with well over 30 customers, I have come up with templates which fit for the majority of typical access switch situations. 

Within this section we will only deal with the non Fabric environment and deployment.

## Summary
These examples are ready for testing in your lab. These are aides to help you get up to speed with what is possible when automating with DNA Center. The intent of this part of the repository is to aide in learning and not provide production ready templates. All templates here are for **LAB Purposes ONLY** and by downloading any content you acknowledge that this is not production ready code.
