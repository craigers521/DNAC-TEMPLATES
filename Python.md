## Python and DNA Center
It is no secret that Python programming language has gained tremendous popularity in the developer community. 
As reported by 2021 Stack Overflow Developer Survery, Python was identified as the number one most wanted language among developers who are not currently using it. DNA Center has a large number of very powerful automation workflows already built into the product (ie Plug and Play, SWIM, SDA, Templates etc), which are also exposed to the operator via programmable API interfaces which can be leverged to further integrate DNA Center into more complex or customized automation workflows.
Given Python popularity, it makes sense to review how you can apply basic programming practices to automate common tasks in your own network with DNA Center APIs.

DNA Center programmable REST API capabilities are covered in our previous tutorial section, [REST API](./RestAPI.md) - REST API and Cisco DNA Center. This section will build upon API foundational concepts introduced in that earlier section

Cisco DNA Center supports the expression of business intent for network use cases, including base automation capabilities in an enterprise network.
