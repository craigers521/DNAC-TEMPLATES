# Hierarchy Build Python

The Python programming language is a powerful tool for building programs related to REST-API calls and allows us to utilize several features to accomplish everyday tasks. In this section of the tutorial, we will use a simple REST-API set, which has been grouped into a Python program.

## Python Program `deploy_hierarchy.py`

These Python program files are groupings of API, which allow us to have workflows defined for specific tasks. Programs also have modules included in them which allows for the reusability of code. 

To investigate this collection, follow these steps:

1. On the **script server** do the following:

   1. Open the program using NANO in Read Only

```SHELL
      sudo nano -v /root/DEVWKS-2176/deploy_hierarchy.py
```

   2. As you scroll through the lines of the program take note of the following:

      - **import** statements for dependant modules and libraries
      - **YAML** a YAML file is used for environment settings
      - **definitions** functions are defined to build API interactions 

      ![json](./images/.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   
   3. This set of **REST-API** are built utilizing the developer site [**developer.cisco.com/docs/dna-center/**](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/dna-center/). This documentation is kept up to date with the latest **REST-API**.
