# API Automation & Orchestration Techniques 
## Overview
This Lab is designed as a standalone lab to help customers with varying challenges in Automating and Orchestrating their network infrastructure. Within the lab we will make use of various tools and techniques to Automate various tasks, and orchestrate over DNA Center.

## General Information
Up until this point we have used Rest-API for some basic set up tasks, but their are so many varying situations that can be solved or atleast eased utilizing Rest-API inconjunction with DNA Center.

## Lab Section 1 - DNA Center Design Preparation
While a more extensive set of settings can be built out for deployment, we will limit the configuration to the minimum necessary to perform this step, building off the completed tasks in lab 2.

### Step 1 - ***Create a Day N Template***

## Automating Claiming and Provisioning
While it is possible to click through the claiming and provisioning processes manually, which can be time-consuming, we can handle bulk deployments differently. For Bulk deployments, after the templates are built and assigned to the network profile and a site, we may automate them further by uploading a CSV file to DNA Center via REST API.

## Summary
The next step will be to build Composite Template to include the Day N regular templates created in this lab for the switches to be pushed out to the various devices in the network infrastructure. 

## Feedback
If you found this set of Labs helpful, please fill in comments and [give feedback](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/f75ce15c2053435283a025b1872257fe) on how it could be improved.
