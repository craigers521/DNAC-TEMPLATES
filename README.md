# DNAC-TEMPLATES [![published](https://static.production.devnetcloud.com/codeexchange/assets/images/devnet-published.svg)](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/repo/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES)
## Overview
This Repository will give examples of templates used in DNA Center that can be modified. Additional information will be included to hopefully give a well rounded explanation of Automation methods with Templates using DNA Center and flows with both Onboarding and DayN Templates and concepts.

The repository will include scripts and examples with the following:
1. Velocity Scripting
2. Variables
3. Binding Variables
4. Composite Templates

The goal of this repository is a practical guide to allow engineers to rapidly begin using DNAC automation and begin conversion of IOS CLI Templates. The Templates they may have been using over the years and with various use cases and so the intent is to reduce the lift to begin automating.

## Intent Based Networking
Either one or multiple Templates may be used to deploy Intent in combination with the Design Settings and Policies deployed within the UI. One or Multiple templates may be used in Onboarding (PnP) or Day N methods. Day N methods are designed for making ongoing changes and may require 'no' statements depending on the configuration construct being modified. 

Additionally:
1.	Intent can be defined as the set of configuration constructs deployed via a template.
2.	Variables can be used to modify or choose between constructs deployed via decision (‘IF’) statements
3.	Repetition of any construct may be introduced through the use of Looping structures on any device.
4.	Variables may be used when the device is being onboarded or provisioned

## Tutorial Sections
Various sections will be covered within this github repository please use this menu for navigation. Within the various folders are examples, explanation readme files for reference.

## [DNAC Template LABS](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/tree/master/LABS#dnac-template-labs-)
This section is built out in LAB form to guide you through the typical steps required to enable the various automation tasks delivered by DNA Center. This lab will give examples of templates used in DNA Center that can be modified for your use and tested on equipment within the LAB environment. Additional information within the lab provides a well-rounded explanation of Automation methods with Templates. Lastly, the lab allows for customers to use DNA Center workflows to practice deploying Onboarding, DayN Templates, and Application Policy automation on both Wired and Wireless Platforms.

The goal of this lab is for it to be a practical guide to aid engineers to rapidly begin using DNA Center automation and help them work towards a template strategy. Additionally, this lab will give customers a permanent place to try out the templates and include configurations for various use cases. This environment will enable engineers to reduce the time and effort needed to instantiate the network.

As a result, customers will gain experience setting up Plug and Play onboarding and templates. Additionally, they will use advanced velocity templating and troubleshooting tools, which may help during faultfinding to determine what is failing in a deployment.

## [DNAC Templates Store](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-Templates-Store)
This repository is built out to share DNA Center Templates and allow for ongoing submissions from those inclined to share their work with the community. Initially the repository includes all the examples that we have used in this repository in RAW TEXT and JSON format. After your first submission you will be able to continually add your templates as you develop new and interesting approaches to device management.

## DCLOUD as a LAB
### Overview
To help aid customers toward success with DNA Center Automation, You may utilize the above labs as they have been designed to work within DCLOUD's  [Cisco Enterprise Networks Hardware Sandbox v2.1](https://dcloud2-rtp.cisco.com/content/demo/759521?returnPathTitleKey=favourites-view) Lab. This allows you to run these labs and gives not only an environment to try the various code, but to develop and export your own code for use in production. This give the customer an environment where they can safely POC/POV methods and steps without harming their own production environments. This also negaes the need for shipping equipment, lead times, and licensing issues needed to get moving rapidly. Please do adhere to the best practices for the DCLOUD environment when using it.

The environment allows for use with a web-based browser client for VPN-less connectivity, access as well as AnyConnect VPN client connectivity for those who prefer it. The labs are hosted out of our San Jose and RTP Facilities and so you would choose sessions from either US East or US West. Choose the Cisco Enterprise Network Sandbox v2.1 or 3.1. To access this or any other content, including demonstrations, labs, and training in Cloud please work with your Cisco Account team or Cisco Partner Account Team directly. Your Account teams will make sure the session is scheduled and shared for you to use. Once booked follow the guide within Github to complete the tasks adhering to the best practices of the dCLOUD environment.

## Examples
These examples must be used with two conditions:
* Deployed a PnP Discovery method and DHCP scope - see [PnP Workflow](./PnP-Workflow.md#pnp-workflow)
* Build the template with methods detailed - see [Creating Templates](./Templates.md#template-creation)

Specific examples of Templates are available in the following folders:
* [PnP Onboarding](./ONBOARDING) - Examples of PnP/ZTP Templates explained in [Onboarding Templates](./Onboarding.md#onboarding-templates-and-flows)
* [DayN](./DAYN) - Examples of DayN Templates explained in [DayN Templates](./DayN.md#day-n-templates-and-flows)
